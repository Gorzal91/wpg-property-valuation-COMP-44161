# Winnipeg Property Valuation Model

This repository contains my solution for the technical challenge (Opportunity No. 44161).  
The goal is to build an automated valuation model predicting residential property values in Winnipeg using open data.

## Repository structure

- `data/` – local data storage (excluded from GitHub)
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development
- `src/` – Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- `results/` – figures and model outputs

## Setup

To run the project, create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
