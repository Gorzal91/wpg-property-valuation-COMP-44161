# Comments to histogram chart 'assessed value distribution'

# 1 High Concentration: The vast majority of assessed values are clustered in a narrow range between 10^5 and 10^6.

# 2 Extreme Skewness: The distribution is highly positively skewed,
    with a sharp mode and a long, sparse tail extending towards $1 billion.

# 3 Log Scale Necessity: The use of a logarithmic x-axis is essential to visualize the entire dataset,
    effectively separating the main population from the high-value outliers
